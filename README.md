#### Colour Scheme

- With a lot of the photography centering around landscapes and nature I wanted to keep the colour scheme as simple as possible to let the photographs do the talking on the page. 
- The choice of Green and White was used to promote the nature aspect of the photographs and give them a clear chance to shine through on the page.

#### Typography 

- Lato was used for the main font throughout the site as it is clear and easy to read. 
- Kanit was used as the more stylised font for the heading.
